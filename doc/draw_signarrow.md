# Draw_SignArrow Extension Documentation

The Draw_SignArrow extension will create a series of sign arrows and 
add them to a layer on the current drawing. The sign arrow dimensions 
are specified on the FHWA's 
*Standard Highway Signs and Markings* book Appendix Page 6-2.

There are two ways to draw a sign arrow. The first way is to draw 
an arrow with a specified A value (e.g., A=4in) and then scale it 
up or down depending on the required A size.  The second way is to 
create an arrow with specified A, B, C, D, E values on the table and 
draw exactly as specified.  Experiment has shown that difference 
between arrows produced by those two methods is very small, so 
either way is valid. 

This extension program creates the series of arrows specified on 
the table. If you accidentally click the menu item and want to 
go back, you can either press `Ctrl + z` to cancel or delete 
the layer with name `Layer arrows`.
